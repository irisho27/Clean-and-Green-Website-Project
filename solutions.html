    <h2 class= "lsolheader"> Ways To Help </h2>
    <h4 class= "solheader">Reduce Water Waste</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">It takes a lot of energy to pump, heat, and treat water, so reducing water waste will in turn help reduce carbon pollution. According to the EPA, if one out of every 100 American homes installed water-efficient fixtures it would save nearly 100 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, preventing 80,000 tons of global warming pollution.</p>

    <h4 class= "solheader">Reduce Food Waste</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">Did you know that food waste is an enormous contributor to climate change? The carbon footprint of the amount of food wasted globally is about 3.3 billion tons of CO2. If it was a country, it would be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter, behind China and and the U.S. Around 10% of the energy used in the U.S. goes into growing, processing, transporting, cooking, and disposing of the food we eat. About 40% of the food ends up in landfills. </p>

    <h4 class= "solheader">Invest in Energy Efficient Appliances</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">When shopping for appliances look for the Energy Star Label. Since 1987, efficiency standards for dozens of appliances have kept 2.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. That's roughly the amount of annual carbon pollution produced by over 440 million cars.</p>

    <h4 class= "solheader">Unplug</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">The average home is powering 65 different devices even when they aren't charging. This load of idle devices adds up to 50 large power plants in the U.S. So, unplug items that aren't in use or are rarely used.</p>

    <h4 class= "solheader">Renewable Energy</h4>
    <p class="paragraph">Nearly 40% of U.S. CO2 pollution comes from power plants burning fossil fuels. Using renewable energy such as solar and wind is crucial in the fight against climate change because it doesn't emit CO2 or other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.</p>
