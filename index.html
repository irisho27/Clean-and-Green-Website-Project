          <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>

          <p>Climate change is a change in the usual weather found in a place. This could be a change in how much rain a place usually gets in a year. Or it could be a change in a place's usual temperature for a month or season.</p>
          <p>Climate change is also a change in Earth's climate. This could be a change in Earth's usual temperature. Or it could be a change in where rain and snow usually fall on Earth.</p>
          <p>Weather can change in just a few hours. Climate takes hundreds or even millions of years to change.</p>

          <h2>Are people really being affected by climate change?</h2>
          <p><strong>YES!</strong> Human health is vulnerable to climate change. The changing environment is expected to cause more heat stress, an increase in waterborne diseases, poor air quality, and diseases transmitted by insects and rodents. Extreme weather events can compound many of these health threats. To learn more, click <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts">here.</a></p>
          <h2>Why We Need To Act Now..</h2>
          <h3> Global Temperature Rise</h3>
          <p>The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.12 degrees Fahrenheit (1.18 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record. </p>
          <h3> Sea Level Rise</h3>
          <p> Global sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of the last century and accelerating slightly every year</p>
          <h3>Extreme Events</h3>
         <p>The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. The U.S. has also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events.</p>
          <h3>Glacial Retreat</h3>
         <p>Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world — including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska, and Africa.</p>
